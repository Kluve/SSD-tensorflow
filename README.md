# SSD-tensorflow
SSD on tensorflow

A much simple SSD on tensorflow.

Remember to change the data path in config.py or other parameters.
(by the way we use VOC2012 datasets)

Run network.py to train your model or leave your E-mail address, and I will send you a pre-trained model.

Run SSD_API.py to achieve target detection.
